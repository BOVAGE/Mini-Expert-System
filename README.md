# Mini-Expert-System
This is an expert system that knows the capital city of the states in Nigeria. The states and their capital cities are stored in text file.
The program doesn't know all the states in Nigeria but you can teach it.

If the program is asked a state it doesn't know its capital, the program will inform you and ask if you know the capital city. The next time you
ask for it again, the program will tell you.
